ECX30DaysOfCodeAndDesign.
This challenge was organized by Engineering Career Expo of the University of Lagos, Akoka, to test students who trained 
under various ECX tracks namely Python, Frontend, Backend, Data Analytics and UI/UX Design.
I partook in this challenge to test my understanding of Python programming which I've been learning for the past few weeks.
Ciao.
