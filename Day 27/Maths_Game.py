# python | Day 27
# Maths game.
# Using Python, create a game with the following rules:
# 1) A(randomly generated) basic algebraic
# expression is displayed onto the screen.(E.G 36ร47, or 117 รท 9, etc.)
# 2) The user is required to provide an answer to the expression within 10 seconds.
# 3) If the user provides a RIGHT answer, he gains {10x(the number of seconds left)} points
# 4) If the user provides a WRONG answer,
# or the time elapsed, the player loses a life.
# 5) At the start of the game, the player provides his name, and begins playing with 3 lives.
# 6) The player loses once he has exhausted his 3 lives.
# Note:
# ~Only +,-,, operations are allowed. ~In the case of a division operation,
# the two numbers generated MUST be divisible.
